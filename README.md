**MCP stands for Model Context Protocol** an open standard developed by Anthropic to allow AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to interact with external tools, services, and data in a standardized way. It essentially acts as a universal translator, enabling AI agents to access and utilize various resources without needing custom integrations for each one.
